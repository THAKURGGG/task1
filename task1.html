<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
<p>The process of teaching a computer, a robot under computer control, or software to think intelligently and similarly to intelligent humans is known as artificial intelligence. The process of creating artificial intelligence (AI) involves first understanding how the human brain functions and how people learn, make decisions, and collaborate to solve problems. The results of this research are then used to create intelligent software and systems.</p>

<h1>What is the Importance of Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
<p>The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) include time savings, a decrease in human error, and improved results. Artificial intelligence (AI) may automate tedious management, planning, and design chores, freeing up human labor to concentrate on more intricate and imaginative tasks.
